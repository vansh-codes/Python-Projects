# Days Survived

**Days Survived** is a Python project that calculates the number of days a user has lived and the number of days remaining based on their birthdate. It provides three different implementations: a basic CLI version, an enhanced CLI version with user choices, and a GUI version using Tkinter.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following files:

1. **days_survived.py**: A basic CLI version of the days calculator.
2. **days_survived_v2.py**: An enhanced CLI version that allows user choices for additional features.
3. **gui_days_survived.py**: A GUI-based version using Tkinter for a more interactive experience.

## Dependencies

To run the GUI-based version of the project, you need the following Python packages:

- `tkinter` (usually included with Python installations)
- `tkcalendar`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tkcalendar
```

## Usage

### CLI Versions

1. **Basic CLI Version**:

   To run the basic CLI version, use the following command:

   ```bash
   python days_survived.py
   ```

   Follow the prompts to enter your birthdate and get the results.

2. **Enhanced CLI Version**:

   To run the enhanced CLI version with additional options, use:

   ```bash
   python days_survived_v2.py
   ```

   This version allows you to choose additional features and options.

### GUI Version

To run the GUI-based version, execute:

```bash
python gui_days_survived.py
```

The GUI application will open, allowing you to select your birthdate using a calendar widget and view the results in a user-friendly interface.
