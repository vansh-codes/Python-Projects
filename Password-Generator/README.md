# Password Generator

This project provides two implementations of a password generator: a basic command-line interface (CLI) version and a graphical user interface (GUI) version. 

## Project Structure

The project contains the following files:

1. **`password_generate.py`**: CLI version of the password generator.
2. **`gui_password_generate.py`**: GUI version of the password generator using Tkinter.

## Dependencies

To run the GUI version, ensure you have the following Python package installed:

- `tkcalendar` (used in Tkinter GUI)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tkcalendar
```

## Usage

### CLI Version

To use the CLI version:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `password_generate.py`.
3. Run the script with:

    ```bash
    python password_generate.py
    ```

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to generate a password.

### GUI Version

To use the GUI version:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `gui_password_generate.py`.
3. Run the script with:

    ```bash
    python gui_password_generate.py
    ```

4. A window will open where you can input the desired length for the password and generate it by clicking the "Generate Password" button.

## Functionality

### CLI Version

- Prompts the user to input the desired length of the password.
- Generates a password with a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.
- Displays the generated password and allows the user to generate multiple passwords or exit.

### GUI Version

- Provides a user-friendly interface with input fields and buttons.
- Allows the user to specify the length of the password.
- Displays the generated password in a central text entry field.
- Includes an "Exit" button to close the application.
